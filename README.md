## Introduction
The repository contains the testing codes and pretrained weights for Anime2Sketch.

Anime2Sketch is a sketch extractor that works well on illustration, anime art, and manga. It is an application based on the paper ["Adversarial Open Domain Adaption for Sketch-to-Photo Synthesis"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05703).

## Prerequisites
- Linux or macOS
- Python 3 (Recommend to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux))
- CPU or NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN
- [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)


## Get Started
### Installation using Conda Environment
```
##Note: tested on Ubuntu 18.04 using Cuda 10.2
git clone https://github.com/Mukosame/Anime2Sketch.git
cd ./Anime2Sketch
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate a2s
```

### Installation using Conda commands
```
##Note: You can change the Cuda version to the one that you desire, here it is 10.2
git clone https://github.com/Mukosame/Anime2Sketch.git
cd ./Anime2Sketch
conda create -n a2s python=3.6
conda activate a2s
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio torchtext cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
```

### Installation using pip `installing the required packages`
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Download Pretrained Weights
Please download the weights from [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Srf-WYUixK0wiUddc9y3pNKHHno5PN6R?usp=sharing), and put it into the [weights/](weights/) folder.

### Test
```Shell
python3 test.py --dataroot /your_input/dir --load_size 512 --output_dir /your_output/dir
```
The above command includes three arguments:
- dataroot: your test file or directory
- load_size: due to the memory limit, we need to resize the input image before processing. By default, we resize it to `512x512`.
- output_dir: path of the output directory

Run our example:
```Shell
python3 test.py --dataroot test_samples/madoka.jpg --load_size 512 --output_dir results/
```

### Train
This project is a sub-branch of [AODA](https://github.com/Mukosame/AODA). Please check it for the training instructions.
